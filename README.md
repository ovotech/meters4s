# Meters4s

Meters4s is a thin, functional wrapper around [Micrometer](https://micrometer.io/) designed to integrate
with the [Cats](https://typelevel.org/cats/) ecosystem. This allows for in-process metrics aggregation
for counters, timers, gauges and distributions.

## This library has now moved to (keirlawson/meters4s)[https://github.com/keirlawson/meters4s]
